# ðŸŒ± the-dsa-journey

Welcome to my DSA learning repository â€” a growing collection of topic-wise solutions in **C++** and **Java**.

This space is where I explore core computer science concepts, practice problem-solving, and build a strong foundation for coding interviews and development.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

Arrays & Strings  
Linked Lists  
Stacks & Queues  
Recursion & Backtracking  
Searching & Sorting  
Hashing & Bit Manipulation  
Sliding Window & Two Pointer  
Dynamic Programming  
Trees & Graphs  
Greedy Algorithms

## ðŸ§  Purpose

To maintain consistency in learning, strengthen logic, and track progress across both languages through clean and readable code.

## âœ… Progress

Currently revisiting and implementing concepts in Java while preserving earlier C++ work.
