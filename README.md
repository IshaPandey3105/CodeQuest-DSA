# ðŸŒ± the-dsa-journey

Welcome to my DSA learning repository â€” a growing collection of topic-wise solutions in **C++** and **Java**.

This space is where I explore core computer science concepts, practice problem-solving, and build a strong foundation for coding interviews and real-world development.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Searching & Sorting
- Hashing & Bit Manipulation
- Sliding Window & Two Pointer
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repository serves as my **learning log** and **progress tracker** for mastering DSA.

- Started with **C++** for problem-solving and competitive programming.
- Now shifting to **Java** to strengthen object-oriented concepts and align with development projects.
- The goal is to write **clean, topic-wise solutions** and build consistency through practice.

## âœ… Current Progress

- âœ… Completed initial practice of DSA fundamentals in **C++** (arrays, recursion, basic data structures).
- ðŸš€ Currently revisiting all topics and re-implementing solutions in **Java** to gain deeper understanding.
- ðŸ“‚ Repository is organized by **language** and then **topic**, making it easy to navigate and track growth.
- ðŸ“– Actively solving problems from **sheets & contests** to reinforce learning.

âš¡ _This repo grows as I grow â€” from fundamentals to advanced problem-solving in both languages._
